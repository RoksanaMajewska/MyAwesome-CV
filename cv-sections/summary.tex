During my previous employment I have developed over 10-year experience in managing several hundred node networks both local and geographically distributed. I have been dealing with networking infrastructure optimization in order to meet the growing needs of modern datacenter in terms of both services availability and traffic monitoring. I have been enforcing the company's security policy by deploying and managing Next Generation Firewall systems.

I've been working along with datacenter operators and DevOps, being in touch with the cutting-edge technological hardware and software based solutions. A similar approach that drives DevOps community spurs me on to look for solutions that guarantee security, scalability and elasticity in a datacenter networking workload.

In the near future I would like to focus my attention on network provisioning and process automation as well as studying implementations of Software Defined Networking (SDN) for flexible and programmatic network configuration.
